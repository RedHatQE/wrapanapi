        Constructor for an entity

        An entity is always tied to a specific system

        Args:
            system -- the implementation of wrapanapi.systems.System this entity "resides on"
            raw -- the raw representation of this entity, if already known. This can be an instance
                object as returned by the underlying API/library we use to communicate with
                'system', or it may simply be a dict of JSON data.
            kwargs -- kwargs that are required to uniquely identify this entity

        An entity can be instantiated in two ways:
            1) passing in the 'raw' data
            2) passing in the 'minimal params' (via the kwargs) needed to be able to get the
               correct 'raw' data from the API

        Sometimes kwargs may be required even with method #1 if the 'raw' data which represents
        this entity doesn't provide all the info necessary to look it up (for example, the
        'azure.storage.models.Blob' class does not contain info on 'container', which is needed
        to look up the blob)

        'kwargs' should be the smallest set of args we can use to pull the right info for this
        entity from the system using self.refresh(). These 'unique kwargs' correlate to the
        self._identifying_attrs property below. For many systems, this may be just a uuid, or in
        cases of systems on which names cannot be duplicated, this may be just the 'name' itself.

        'raw' may optionally be passed in at instantiation in cases where we already have obtained
        the raw data for an entity. If this is the case, instance variables will need to be set for
        the 'unique kwargs' based on the given raw data and 'unique kwargs' are not required.

        Whether an instance is created using 'raw', or created using 'kwargs', if it is the same
        entity, the self._identifying_attrs property MUST be equal.
